# Cat and Track: A Project for Hacker413 of Spring 2024

## Inspiration
Faced with the difficulties of college life, many students struggle to eat, sleep, and study properly. We wanted to create something that would incentivize people to actually improve their quality of life through the one thing that can push most of us to do something we don't want to: competition. We were inspired by existing apps like Habitica, but our goal was to make it simple to understand and use so that we can encourage people to use it while still having key features, especially a Leaderboard. We also wanted to make it seamlessly integrate with many peoples' time tracker, Google Calendar. 

## What it does
It mainly features a to-do list with a game-like flourish, where you get points in categories for what you complete. Currently its functions are that of a basic to-do app, but we are in progress working on adding the leaderboard and the Calendar API.

## How we built it
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we created a web application. We use a GitHub repo to keep all of our changes streamlined. We started by creating the home page, because we felt that was most important to visualize the rest of the application. But we will expand to build other pages, like a leaderboard and a more complex way of organizing and categorizing the tasks beyond a simple list.

## Challenges we ran into
Many of the small mistakes that were made were very unclear due to the nature of HTML and JS, and the fact that none of us had significant HTML experience. We spent many hours debugging to find out that it was a simple mistake. Also, connecting APIs and creating servers is not a simple task because it requires a lot of debugging and background knowledge; it took so much time that we unfortunately couldn't get it done in the 24 hours we had. But we learned a lot and we will be implementing everything going forward

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We really love the UI of Cat and Track, with the cute profile pictures and the smooth adding/checking off items. We also happy with the fact that it functions like a to-do list, with a progress bar. Given how little background we had and how long it took us to get it to work, we are really proud of what we have done in the time we had. 

## What we learned
Next time, we will budget our time to leave more time for the tasks at the end of the hackathon, because that always ends up being where the most important yet complex tasks arise. 

## What's next for CatTracker
Implementing all of our ideas into it! We want to deploy it as a publicly available website and fix the backend server so that we can have multiple users' progress displayed on a leaderboard. We were also planning on adding categories to the tasks and a "category view" page, along with due date options for each task. It would also be interesting to try to implement the tool onto more useful platforms like as an app or on Apple Watch.

# Things that need to be done / Preview of Upcoming Attractions:
- loading in entries from Google Calendar
- leveling up once the progress bar hits 100?
- categories for todo's
  - a by-category view page
- due dates / priorities
- the Leader Board page needs actual leading
- deployment! Cats must be shared
